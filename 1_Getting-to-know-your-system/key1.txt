5. No difference in terms of the resulted product,
   but there are brackets with two new sequences following the result.
6. No. The integers are always 18-bit.
7. The probability is 1/2.
   The product will not overflow only when x and y have different signs.
   Of all random numbers, negative numbers and positive numbers both take up about half,
   so the probability that x and y have different signs is 1/2.
