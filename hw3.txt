Q1.
Brady's patch removed the line "case_long_iso_time_style" because the command "goto case_long_iso_time_style" in the for loop below was removed, so it won't be accessed again. Since it won't be accessed again, removing this line is not neccessary.

Q2.
The patched version may cause problems in an environment that is not using Unix or in countries that does not rely on English-format dates.

Q3.
command: python2 randline.py /dev/null
output:	 Traceback (most recent call last):
  	 File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    	   main()
 	 File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    	   sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  	 File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    	   return random.choice(self.lines)
  	 File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.11/lib/python2.7/random.py", line 275, in choice
    	   return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is empty
	 IndexError: list index out of range
reason: The function "random.choice(self, seq)" requires the seq being non-empty, and it raises IndexError if seq is empty.

Q4.
command: python3 randline.py /dev/null
output:  File "randline.py", line 65
    	   except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      	     ^
		      SyntaxError: invalid syntax
reason: Parameters given in exceptions are iterable for python2 but not for python3.
